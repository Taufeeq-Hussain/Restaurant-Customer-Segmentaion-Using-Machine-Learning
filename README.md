# Restaurant Customer Segmentation

## Overview

This project, implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, focuses on the segmentation of restaurant customers based on various attributes, including gender, age, spending score, dining style, and cuisine preferences. The segmentation is achieved through the implementation of K-means clustering. Additionally, the project involves comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises 200 rows and 6 columns:

1. **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
2. **Gender**: Customer's gender (e.g., Male or Female).
3. **Age**: Customer's age.
4. **Spending Score (1-100)**: A score reflecting the customer's spending behavior, ranging from 1 to 100.
5. **Dining Style**: Customer's preferred dining style (Casual, Fine Dining, Fast Food).
6. **Cuisine Preferences**: Customer's cuisine preferences, including options such as Indian, Italian, Mexican, Thai, American, Korean, and Chinese.

## Clustering Method

The K-means clustering algorithm is implemented using Python. The resulting clusters provide insights into distinct customer groups with similar spending patterns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involves the following visualizations:

- **Count Plot**: Visual representation of the count of customers for each category (e.g., gender, dining style, cuisine preferences).
- **Pair Plots**: Scatterplots displaying relationships between pairs of variables.
- **Histograms**: Distribution of variables such as age, spending score, etc.
- **Heatmap**: Correlation matrix heatmap for numerical variables.
- **Bar Graphs**: Representation of data through bar graphs for better interpretation.
- **Boxplots**: Visualization of the distribution of spending scores and other numerical variables.

## Data Visualization

The project includes a variety of visualizations implemented in Jupyter Notebook to facilitate a better understanding of the dataset and clustering results. These visualizations aid in interpreting customer segments and patterns.


## Results

The main outcomes of the project include identified customer segments, insights into spending patterns, and visual representations of the clustering results.

## Future Work

Potential areas for future development may include expanding the dataset, trying different clustering algorithms, or incorporating additional features for segmentation.
